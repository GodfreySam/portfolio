      <p>
        Over the past three years, I have worked on projects and serviced clients which have
         helped me honed my skill as a software engineer and web developer.
        I have developed a good track record with frontend technologies such as HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript as well as javaScript libraries such as Jquery and Reactjs.
        I have also worked with JavaScript on backend using Node.js, Express.js and
        Handlebars and Embedded-JavaScript-templates as template engine for server-side
        rendering, I have also worked with databases such as NEDB for in-memory data storage
        and management, MongoDb and Mongoose for larger datasets at the backend, REST API, 
        Graphql, Axios and browser inbuilt fetch API. I believe I have a lot to offer as an
        engineer who has been working hard at his craft; I have a quick grasp of new concepts
        and technology which is why I am working hard to build a successful career as a software
        engineer and hopefully be reckoned with as an expert in my field. <br>
        Amongst some of my <a href="/work" class="text-secondary app-title">projects </a> are
        <a href="#" class="text-secondary app-title">Epin-Sorter</a>; a Chrome-extension browser app 
        for the sorting and printing of vouchers hosted on chrome web store for private use for Esty
        Telecom company which is also being ordered for by interested companies in similar business.

        The Epin-Sorter Chrome-extension inspired me to develop the web version of the application which is hosted at
        <a href="http://epinsorter.com" class="text-secondary app-title">epinsorter.com</a>; this was so that i could
        reach a wider audience of interested user in an automated way using subscription payment method to grant registered
        user access to the full functionality. <br>
        So for that, i became a proud Founder at three years into web development.
